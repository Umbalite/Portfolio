Portfolio assignment, meant to represent my work and skills I have.
Unfortunately, I was stricken for time and had some issues in finishing in a timely manner. This page is a WIP, as I have not completed enough sites/pages to fill my columns with images. (You will see a placeholder of a site I have already made.) Over time I wish to keep updating and refining this page, so that it may be ready for presentation to future employers. As for now, I am simply submitting it to confirm that I have done the work, recieve my grade and input on where I can improve.
Had issues in getting footer background to load, so for now I simply have allowed for the links to stay where they are.
Some links are generic, such as "Google.com" I have had issues making a linkedin account, and my instagram page was locked. Thus, I simply put generic links to show the knowledge of how to insert them, and on my next revision (post submission) I will be inserting my links. Did not feel comfortable putting all that information out until I had properly formatted a page.
Page is still a WIP, labeled images with a simplified alt attribute so that graders understand I will be editing over time, this is a submission mainly focused on showing the core items that had to be presented as "learned." 
I don't have any images of myself that I deemed appropriate, so I added a placeholder of my favorite anime and it's main character. I will be changing that once I take a new picture and finalize the site. It's alt attribute is simply stated in a way for graders to understand, I know I must change it for accessibility purposes.
